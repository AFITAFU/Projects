I keep receiving this: Internal Server Error

The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.

Please contact the server administrator, admin@localhost and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error.

More information about this error may be available in the server error log. Please how do I fix it, Thanks

Have you ensured that mod_rewrite is enabled? For WAMP, click the WAMP icon in your tool bar and go to Apache > Apache Modules > rewrite_module and ensure that it has a checkmark next to it.
